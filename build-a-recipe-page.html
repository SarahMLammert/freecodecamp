  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate chopped</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450F. Butter and lightly flour 6 (4- to 5-ounce) ramekins and place them on a baking
          sheet.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter and chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until smooth. Or, place
          the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring every 30-seconds until
          melted. Whisk together until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until thick and
          pale yellow. Fold the chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture until well combined. Divide the batter
          among the prepared ramekins.</li>
        <li>Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes are firm set but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes
          cool in the ramekins for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and carefully turn it over, inverting the cake onto
          the plate. Let stand for about 10 seconds, then remove the ramekin to unmold the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on
          top and garnish with berries, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
